<h1> SUMMIT Releases + Downloads</h1>

Each version of SUMMIT is matched with that of CARLA. For example, SUMMIT version 0.9.8 includes all the CARLA features up to CARLA version 0.9.8.

In order to speed up downloads, the **lite** versions exclude a significant amount of CARLA assets that you probably won't need to run SUMMIT. If you need access to all CARLA assets, please download the **non-lite** versions.
